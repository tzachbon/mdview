## Learnings
- @types/marked-terminal v6 doesn't match marked-terminal v7, requires type assertion as MarkedExtension
- Spec synthesized in quick mode (2026-02-01)
- Tech stack validated: marked ^12.0.0, marked-terminal ^7.0.0, beautiful-mermaid ^0.1.0, chalk ^5.3.0
- beautiful-mermaid is newer library (^0.1.0) - POC phase will validate it works as expected
- Bun provides native stdin via `Bun.stdin.text()` and file reading via `Bun.file().text()`
- Mermaid detection uses regex pre-processing before marked-terminal (cleaner than marked plugin)
- Architecture follows three-module pattern: CLI entry, renderer, mermaid handler
- 18 tasks across 4 phases: POC (6), Refactor (3), Testing (4), Quality (5)
- beautiful-mermaid provides `renderMermaidAscii` for terminal-friendly output
- Test strategy: unit tests for mermaid.ts and renderer.ts, integration tests for CLI
